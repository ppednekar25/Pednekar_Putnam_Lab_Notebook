# KNOW YOUR NUDIBRANCHS : NUDIBRANCHS FROM NEW ENGLAND 

*This is a fun post about the four nudibranch species I found in the intertidal rocks of Nahant, MA while tidepooling in the Spring 2025.*

## **NUDIBRANCHS (nudus: Naked; brankhia: gills)**
Nudibranchs are marine soft-bodied mollusks which have two main characteristics. They lack a shell unlike any other snail/mollusk and have external gills either in the form of gill plume or cerata.

There are typically two kinds of nudibranchs:

A. Dorid Nudibranch- Flat disc shaped body, external gills on the back looking like a plume or tree. Sometimes when they feel threatened, they retract their gills inside the body.

B. Aeolid Nudibranch- Unlike dorids, aeolids have a narrow mantle with finger like extensions/projections called as the cerata (external gills in aeolids). The tips of the ceratas stored cnidosacs containing nematocysts obtained from their food sources like sea anemones, hydroids or other cnidarians.

### 1. _Dendronotus frondosus_-Bushy-backed nudibranch
 - Feeds on a variety of hydroids in the mid intertidal to shallow sublittoral.
 - Commonly found nudibranch on the pacific and east coast of the United States
 - Mantle comprises of eight-nine branched processes/cerata.

### 2. _Ancula gibbosa_-Humped Ancula Sea Slug
 - It is a dorid nudibranch with rhinophores and gills having colored tips. 
 - They are known to feed on colonial ascidians like that of _Botryllus_, _Botrylloides_ sp. but can also feed on bryozoans.
 - The Humped Ancula Sea slug has several processes rising around the gill cluster.

### 3. _Archidoris pseudoargus_-Sea Lemon

 - They are known to feed on sponges found in the east coast waters.
 - _Archidoris pseudoargus_ been a dorid nudibranch, have its external gills arranged in a circle.
 - The adult individuals could depict several hues of yellow with red, pink as well as purple patterns on the body.

### 4. _Aeolidia papillosa_-Shag-rug nudibranch/ Shaggy mouse nudibranch 

 - The shaggy mouse nudibranch has two dense rows of cerata.
 - As they are very cryptic to the surrounding because of their color, they often go unnoticed and misinterpreted for anemones.
 - This nudibranch species feeds on sea anemones and sometimes on hydroids.

# Lastly, nudibranchs are cool and so are you!!! This post was just to enlighten cool creatures like the nudis that exists in the intertidals of the world and often go unnoticed.

All the images included in this post are clicked by me through the Olympus TG-6 camera *apart* from the cool click of the _Goniobranchus trimarginatus_ by my dad.
