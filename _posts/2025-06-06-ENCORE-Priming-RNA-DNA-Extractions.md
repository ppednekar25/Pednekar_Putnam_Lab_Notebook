## RNA and DNA Extractions for ENCORE Priming Project

### [Protocol Link](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/) and [Here](https://github.com/flofields/Florence_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2025-05-08-Protocol-Zymo-Quick-DNA-RNA-Extraction.md)

### Extractions of 4 samples from ENCORE Priming Project. These samples were collected in Bermuda in June 2024 for the ENCORE Priming project. There are 100 *Madracis decactis* (MDEC) samples total. 

## Samples

These samples are apart of day 13 of processing. Samples were randomly selected out of the 100 total being used for Extractions. Samples were either apart of a three phase priming experiment that included the first stage; Priming where the coral were exposed to 3 treatments high temperature (31ºC), low pH (~7.75) and control (27ºC). The second stage; recovery, where they underwent a week recovery period under control conditions (28ºC). The thrid stage was exposure to a stress which was high temperature (32ºC). 

Samples MD-5, MD-5-18, MD-4, MD-4-4, MD-4-6, MD-1-19 were extracted 2025-06-05 by FF but qbitted and ran on a gel the next day 2025-06-06 with the other samples MD-4-19, MD-2-22. MD-5-8, MD-5-23 which was extracted by PP as part of my molecular training. Sample MD-4-19 was extracted again on 2025-06-06 by PP but has been extracted before in May 2025 by 

## Notes

- Followed this [protocol](https://github.com/flofields/Florence_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2025-05-08-Protocol-Zymo-Quick-DNA-RNA-Extraction.md) exactly. 
- RNA and DNA were extracted from frozen samples in 1mL of [DNA/RNA shield](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/dna-rna-shield)
- For sample preperation bead beat was used and added to the orginal tube. The sample was then votexed for 1 mintue and spinned downed after.
- Durin the DNA extraction samples were inverted in step 5 not flicked.
- During both extractions samples were eluted in 80uL of Tris or DNase/RNase free water (50uL on the first elution and 30 on the next).

## Qubit Results

- Used Broad range dsDNA and RNA Qubit Protocol [HERE](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/) and [HERE](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-03-08-Qubit-Protocol.md)
- All samples read twice, standard only read once

## DNA and RNA Quality Check: Gel, using this [protocol](https://github.com/flofields/Florence_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2025-05-23-Gel-Protocol.md)

Note: DNA from sample MD-4-6 came out the gel along with samples MD-1-19 and MD-5-8. Sample MD-4-4 ran on a different gel showing a very faint 1 band, gel should be reran with the sample along with the samples that came out of the gel. Only 2 sample were out of range and will be redone by NC with the high sensitivity kit.
